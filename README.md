# Final Exemptions Website
This is a website I have created to streamline my high school's final exam exemption procedure.
Currently, my high school uses a Google Sheet which had been inefficient for all users.

The website has three user groups: students, teachers, and administrators. Students can view only their exemption status.
Teachers can add their personalized schedule and exempt students. Administrators can add all student ids to a database to ensure that
only students who are associated to the school can be exempted.

Technologies used are Django, PicoCSS, and SQLite.

To run the program, run the following command in the terminal after downloading/cloning this repository:
<br>
``python manage.py runserver``
